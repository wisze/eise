# Fonts 

This directory contains the `cmastro` font, converted into truetype. The font was not created by me. 
The original is in metafont and is intended to be used in TeX documents. Original files are to be found at
the [Tex cmastro](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cmastro)
metafont archive.
