# Fonts 

This directory contains a number of fonts for the planet and zodiac symbology. 

The eise.py script uses the `cmastro` font, converted into truetype. The font was not created by me. 
The original is in metafont and is intended to be used in TeX documents. Original files are to be found at
the [Tex cmastro](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cmastro)
metafont archive. 

The ptolemeus.py script uses a number of fonts which are available from the dafont website. 
These used fonts are:
